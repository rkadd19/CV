  <h3>Short overview about me</h3>
  <p>I am currently a student at Seneca College enrolled in the <a href="https://www.senecacollege.ca/programs/fulltime/ACF.html">Accounting and Finance Advanced Diploma program.</a> My goal is to pursue a CPA designation after completing the <a
      href="https://www.senecacollege.ca/programs/fulltime/IAF.html">International Accounting and Finance Bachelors Degree program</a> at Seneca
    College.</p>
  <p>I am a determined, focused student that takes responsibility of all tasks I am assigned. I have great knowledge that I have gained from my college experience in Accounting, Finance, Economics, Business, Business Law and Information Technology. I
    am pursuing a career in Accounting specializing in Taxation in the future as I have passion for understanding the core of Taxation and Accounting and finding different ways of doing things to help my future clients.</p>
  <p>I am a very ambitious and positive individual. I am also a quick learner and enjoy learning new aspects whenever I have the opportunity to do so. I get on well with different cultures and personalities in the workplace as well as in my personal
    life as I love interacting with others. </p>
